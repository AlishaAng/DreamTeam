General rules and stuff:
1. For unavailable data, fill in ‘NULL’ .
2. Export the dataframe into csv and upload into the ‘Data_mining’ folder
3. Inhibitor will need to attach the picture in jpg/png, the folder will possibly be very large, so might need to zip it. 
4. For any functions created, please include a small annotation in the function:
-def get_protein(input):
“””
This function does this
“””
