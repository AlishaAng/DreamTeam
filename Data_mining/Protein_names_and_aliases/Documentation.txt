Documentation for protein names and aliases

The list of human kinases were retrieved from a uniprot page (https://www.uniprot.org/docs/pkinfam, accessed on 14th January, 2019). The uniprot number were then used to query for the protein names from Uniprot through bioservices library available in Python 3.7. The gene aliases are other names that have been given for the same gene. These aliases were retrieved using the same method. Uniprot has been known to be a secure site for biological information. Each entry annotated has at least a degree of evidence to it. As such, the site is deemed a trustable source of information for biological data.
