This folder contains the pre-cleaned list of human kinases.

The source of the file is from https://www.uniprot.org/docs/pkinfam. 

The information is copied onto spreadsheet and then tidied using python3.

The jupyter notebook contains the code of how I tidied them.
The final version is clean_human_kinase.csv.
